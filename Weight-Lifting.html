        <p>Weightlifting is an athletic discipline which requires lifting of heavy weights<br>
	 in a progressive manner. It not only tests the physical prowess of an <br>
	individual but also his/her rate of force generation, i.e., <br>
	ballistic actions of lifting the weights in minimum amount of time.<br><br>

	Strength training may enhance your quality of life and improve your ability<br>
	 to do everyday activities. Strength training can also protect your joints from injury. <br>
	Building muscle also can contribute to better balance and may reduce your risk of falls.<br>
	 This can help you maintain independence as you age.
